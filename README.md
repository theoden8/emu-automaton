# About

The purpose of this project is to animate automata in order to provide intuition for understanding complexity, and is to evolve into a more efficient framework for investigating algorithms and topologies in the languages of various automata.

# Tools

* opengl 4, glew, glfw3

# Compiling

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
